# Surf-Weather-Reports
This is a group project for the UCB Coding Bootcamp

## Features
We wanted to create a web application that allowed users to get surf and weather data

## User Story
AS AN user that lives by the coast and is interested in surf and meteorology
I WANT to check local surf and weather forecasts at the same time
SO THAT I can see where is the best destination for my next surf excursion

GIVEN I want to know data about new locations
WHEN I search a location along the coast
THEN I am given a list of potential locations that match that name
WHEN I click on a new location
THEN the website will use API's to fetch weather and surf forecast data and display that to me
WHEN I click a button to save that location
THEN that location is saved to my favorites in localstorage
WHEN I reload the page
THEN my favorites will be saved
